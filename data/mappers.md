#Data Mappers

Data mappers are most commonly used for building up a link from your
classes / objects in php to your data layer.  Building your code around
entities, such as a "user" object, you can quickly build up your code around
functionality of code, and the data layer can automatically create your database
tables with 'creations', or dynamically store your objects within nosql stores.
