#Data Access

###Attributes

Data attributes are extended values that allow you to filter,
validate and revert your data, as well as knowing what values have
been updated since you initially loaded them.  Attributes form the
foundation for [data mappers](/docs/data/mappers) which control a set
of data, most commonly represented as objects.  Each type of attribute
will offer you slightly different functionality, which allow you build
advanced data mappers to save your data to multiple locations, without
having to bog down your code with functionality.

There are several attribute types available:

- [Base Attribute](/docs/data/attributes#baseattribute)
- [Polymorphic Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#polymorphic)
- [Callback Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#callback)
- [Mutributes](/docs/data/attributes#multribute)
- [Composite Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#composite)
- [Compound Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#compound)
