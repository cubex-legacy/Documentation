#Data Access

###Attributes

Data attributes are extended values that allow you to filter,
validate and revert your data, as well as knowing what values have
been updated since you initially loaded them.  Attributes form the
foundation for [data mappers](/docs/data/mappers) which control a set
of data, most commonly a representation of an object within a database.
Each type of attribute will offer you slightly different functionality,
which allow you build advanced data mappers to save your data to multiple
locations, without having to bog down your code with functionality.

There are several attribute types available:

- [Base Attribute](/docs/data/attributes#baseattribute)
- [Composite Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#composite)
- [Compound Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#compound)
- [Polymorphic Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#polymorphic)
- [Callback Attributes](/docs/data/attributes#callback)
