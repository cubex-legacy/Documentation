Internationalisation Record Mappers
==

I18n mappers allow you to store any properties for your data objects into
separate databases, which store the text alongside the property, class and
language.

These mappers will allow you to maintain dynamic content site, which is also
translatable, moving any translation logic away from your every day code, and
into a more managable infrastructure.

  class TransArticle extends I18nRecordMapper
  {
    public $name;
    public $age;
    public $description;

    protected function _configure()
    {
      $this->_addTranslationAttribute("name", "description");
    }

    /**
     * @return TextContainer
     */
    public function getTextContainer()
    {
      return new TextualContainer;
    }
  }

  class TextualContainer extends TextContainer
  {
  }

TransArticle in this case acts as your source mapper, which would actually only
 store the age column alongside default columns.  The name and description columns
 would only exist within TextualContainer.

The TextualContainer is simply a mapper to where you wish to store your content
for the mapper.  This allows you to extend each row within your database, so
you could introduce an approval system ontop of your translations.
